# Hubs — Rationale

## What deviation / exception is being requested

### 1. The instance is public by design — anyone can create a room without an account

`CONTRIBUTING.md` requires an authentication method enabled by default and names
"a public website that does not require authentication" as a valid exception. Hubs
claims that exception, deliberately and for the whole room-creation surface:

- An anonymous, cookie-free `POST /api/v1/hubs` returns `200` with a
  `creator_assignment_token` and an `embed_token`. That is not a hole — it is the
  **Create Room** button on the landing page, which is the entire product. A Hubs
  instance that requires an account before anyone can open a room is a Hubs
  instance nobody can be invited to.
- Sign-in exists and is Hubs' own (magic link to the address the user enters). It
  buys *persistence and ownership* — saved avatars, scenes, room ownership across
  devices — not access. This is the same shape as the built-in-auth exception
  `CONTRIBUTING.md` grants Jellyfin and Immich, except that here the un-signed-in
  state is a supported end state rather than a window that closes.

**What is *not* public**, verified on demostaging1 from a jar that never signed in:

| Surface | Anonymous result |
|---|---|
| `POST /api/v1/hubs` (create a room) | `200` — deliberate, this is the product |
| `GET /api/v1/meta` (server version/metadata) | `200` — upstream, discloses nothing but the build |
| `GET /api/postgrest/*` (the admin data plane) | **`401`** |
| Admin rights | Held only by `${APP_EMAIL}`, the address `tips.before_install` names |

`/admin` serves its client-rendered shell to anyone, as client-rendered admin panels
do; every datum it renders comes from the PostgREST plane above, which is gated by a
Guardian JWT and answers `401` without one.

**What the operator is accepting** by installing this app: a room-creation endpoint
open to anyone who learns the URL, and therefore storage and bandwidth consumed by
uninvited rooms. Anyone who wants a private instance should front the app with the
AppShield sidecar, at the cost of making invite links useless to anyone without a
PCS account — which for most deployments defeats the purpose.

### 2. Six of the nine services run as root

Six of the nine services in the Hubs stack run as `user: "0:0"`:

- `db` (`postgres:14-alpine`)
- `hubs` (`hubsfoundation/reticulum:stable-855`) — Phoenix backend, the user-facing service
- `postgrest` (`mozillareality/postgrest:8`)
- `hubs-client` (`hubsfoundation/hubs:stable-3111`) — static asset server
- `spoke` (`hubsfoundation/spoke:stable-95`) — scene editor
- `dialog` (`hubsfoundation/dialog:stable-331`) — Mediasoup WebRTC SFU

The remaining three (`nearspark`, `photomnemonic`, `mailpit`) inherit the default `PUID:PGID`.

## Why it is necessary

Every container running as root does so because its **upstream entrypoint expects to start as root and drop privileges itself**:

- `postgres:14-alpine` requires root to `chown -R postgres:postgres "$PGDATA"` before `gosu postgres` re-execs the postmaster as uid 70. Running it as a non-root user up front bypasses that chown and produces the `Permission denied: global/pg_filenode.map` failure mode (which is exactly what triggered the original outage on staging).
- The Hubs Foundation images (`reticulum`, `hubs`, `spoke`, `dialog`) ship with an entrypoint that templates `/home/ret/config.toml` from env vars at startup, writes it under `/home/ret`, and then exec's the application. The template-render step needs write access to a path created at image build time as root.
- `mozillareality/postgrest` has the same upstream-defined entrypoint pattern.
Forcing these images to run unprivileged would require maintaining a downstream rebuild for each — a maintenance burden disproportionate to the security improvement, given the AppData-only volume topology described below.

### 3. Mailpit added for admin magic-link delivery

Hubs authenticates exclusively via magic-link emails. On NSL.sh, `APP_EMAIL` is set to `admin@{domain}` — a non-receivable address — so the admin magic-link cannot be delivered to a real mailbox. Mailpit (`axllent/mailpit`) is added as a local mail capture and relay service:

- **Captures** all outgoing emails from Hubs in a web UI accessible at `https://hubsmail-{domain}`
- **Relays** emails to the platform's `smtp` container for external delivery (regular users with real email addresses receive their magic-links normally)
- The Mailpit web UI is **protected by Basic Auth** (`MP_UI_AUTH`) using the platform-provided `APP_DEFAULT_PASSWORD` as the password

## Security mitigations in place

- **All bind mounts stay inside `/DATA/AppData/hubs/`.** No service mounts `/DATA/Documents`, `/DATA/Downloads`, `/DATA/Media`, or `/DATA/Gallery`. A root-process escape from any Hubs container can only reach the app's own AppData tree, not user-owned content.
- **No `ports:` on the user-facing services.** Only `dialog` exposes host ports (UDP/TCP 40000-40050), required by the Mediasoup SFU for WebRTC media. Everything else is reachable solely via the internal `hubs-net` network and the `pcs` network through Caddy reverse-proxy labels.
- **Caddy gateway termination.** All HTTP/HTTPS traffic is terminated by the PCS's `mesh-router-caddy`, not the Hubs containers themselves. Public Caddy labels point at internal `expose:` ports on the `pcs` network, so direct host-port exposure is limited to the SFU media range.
- **Per-service `cpu_shares`** prevent a runaway service (e.g. compromised `nearspark` thumbnail proxy) from starving the host.
- **Bootstrap secrets are mode `0600`**, owned by `PUID:PGID`. The compose `.env`, `perms.key.pem`, and `perms.pub.pem` are not world-readable.
- **Postgres data dir is owned by uid 70** (the in-image postgres user), declared as `x-compose-app.folders` → `/DATA/AppData/hubs/pgdata` with `user: 70`, `group: 70`, `recursive: true`. Maison applies it before images are pulled and before every `up`, so a stray framework-level chown can't relock the cluster directory and crashloop the database.

## Alternatives considered and rejected

1. **Rebuild upstream images with `USER 1000`.** Rejected — would require maintaining seven downstream forks (`reticulum`, `hubs`, `spoke`, `dialog`, `nearspark`, `photomnemonic`, plus `postgres` if we wanted full coverage) and continuously rebasing on Hubs Foundation's stable tags. The maintenance cost outweighs the marginal security benefit given the AppData-only mount topology.
2. **Run Postgres as `user: "70:70"` directly.** Rejected — the Postgres image's chown step inside the entrypoint requires root. Skipping it leaves `pgdata` owned by uid 1000 (host PUID) and the postgres process (uid 70) cannot read its own data files. We hit exactly this failure mode on the initial Hubs rollout on staging.
3. **Wrap each upstream image with a sidecar that does the chown then signals the main service.** Rejected as over-engineered for the threat model.

## Data protection

- All persistent state lives under `/DATA/AppData/hubs/` and survives uninstall/reinstall. The `x-compose-app.init` step `bootstrap` (`when: once`) runs `hubs-seed bootstrap`, which is **idempotent** — on re-run it preserves existing secrets in `secrets/.env` (DB password, NODE_COOKIE, GUARDIAN_KEY, PHX_KEY, DASHBOARD_ACCESS_KEY, POSTGREST_PASSWORD, PERMS_KEY) and reuses the existing RSA keypair. Regenerating the keypair would invalidate every minted Guardian admin token.
- Framework-passthrough env vars (`APP_DOMAIN`, `APP_PUBLIC_IP_DASH`, `APP_PUBLIC_IPV4`, `APP_EMAIL`, `PUID`, `PGID`) **are** refreshed on every install — that is intentional, so a redeploy fixes drifted Caddy labels (the original outage's root cause).
- The compose's `.env` file is mode `0600`. The RSA private key (`perms.key.pem`) is mode `0600`. Both are owned by `PUID:PGID`.
- No user-owned content (Documents/Downloads/Media/Gallery) is touched by any Hubs container; the blast radius of a root container escape is bounded to `/DATA/AppData/hubs/`.
