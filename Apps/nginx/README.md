# nginx - Static Website Hosting

A lightweight, high-performance static website hosting solution powered by nginx.

## Overview

nginx provides a simple way to host static websites, HTML pages, JavaScript applications, and documentation sites on CasaOS. Built on the industry-standard nginx web server, it delivers content blazingly fast with minimal resource usage.

## Features

- **Zero Configuration**: Drop your files in and start serving immediately
- **Lightning Fast**: nginx delivers static content faster than any alternative
- **Minimal Resources**: Runs efficiently with just 64MB RAM
- **Clean URLs**: Automatic HTTPS access via NSL.SH routing
- **SPA Support**: Pre-configured for single-page applications (React, Vue, Angular)
- **Production Ready**: nginx powers 30% of the internet

## Usage

After installation:

1. Navigate to `/DATA/AppData/nginx/www/`
2. Upload your website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, etc.)
3. Access your site at `https://nginx-[username].nsl.sh/`

### File Structure

```
/DATA/AppData/nginx/
├── www/              # Your website files
