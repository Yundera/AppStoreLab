# üß™ AppStoreLab

**An experimental app store for developers and alpha builds**

AppStoreLab is the testing ground companion to our [main AppStore](https://github.com/Yundera/AppStore). Here, developers can publish experimental apps, alpha builds, and innovative projects without the strict verification requirements of the main store.

## What makes this different?

- **Relaxed verification** - Faster approval process for experimental apps
- **Alpha builds welcome** - Perfect for testing new features and concepts
- **Developer-focused** - Built for iteration and experimentation
- **Community-driven** - Help shape the future of app distribution

‚ö†Ô∏è **Note**: Apps here are experimental and may be unstable. Use at your own discretion.

### Key Differences from Official CasaOS AppStore
Regular CasaOS app URL:
```http://demo.casaos.io:5230/```

Yundera app URL:
```https://memo-demo.nsl.sh```

All apps are designed to run on CasaIMG, a dockerized version of CasaOS.
All apps are accessible over HTTPS by default.
All apps are tested on Yundera servers using a nsl.sh routing domain.
